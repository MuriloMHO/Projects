            </h1>
            <p>
                I came from a beatful contry called Brazil, there we have a huge diversity made off lots of different cultures and etnics.

            <p>
                In Brazil I finished the all elementary school, and I sarted the High School, but I just did 1 of the 3 years, this was because I came to London to live with my mother. All these years in Brazil I did a good overall grade in all the subjects.
