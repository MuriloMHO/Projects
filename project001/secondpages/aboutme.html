                Educational Journey
            </h1>
            <p>
                In Brazil, I completed my elementary school and started high school. However, I only completed the
                first year out of the three because I moved to London to live with my mother. During my time in Brazil,
                I maintained good grades across all subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, here in London, I am studying at the City of Westminster College, which is renowned for its quality
                education. Here are my current courses:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>ICT Level 1</strong>: I am diving into the world of information and communication technology.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>GCSE English and Math</strong>: I am even taking Higher Level Math (and yes, it is a bit challenging, but I
                    am determined!).
